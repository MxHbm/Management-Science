# Management-Science
GitHub for exchanging data and the formulation of the stochastic mathematical model 

# Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project developed as part of a task at Technical University Dresden for the module "Actual Topics in Management Science" by Prof. Becker.

# Short Description
The code investigates a case study for an integrated production and distribution planning for milk diary supply chain.


## Project Summary:

This project aims to understand and reproduce the results presented in the source paper provided. Leveraging Python3 and Gurobi, we delve into the computational aspects of management science, striving to replicate and expand upon the findings presented in the original research.
